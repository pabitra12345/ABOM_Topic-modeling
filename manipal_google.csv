All the staff members were co-operative and were there to help when needed. The operation theater staff including Ms. Merlin kept updated about the status of surgery. This all helped in keeping the overall anxiety level low.

I booked an appointment at 4 PM the previous evening and cancelled the day's plan to allot all my day for the health check up. Travelling is main concern to this place as it is located at one of the prime place in Bangalore. 

The next morning, I set myself up not eating much and keeping my body in tone for check up and I receive a call from them by noon. And here they say, "" your appointment is cancelled, come tomorrow"" without any intimation. This has caused inconvenience for the third time in three weeks consequently. 

People with hope are discouraged at Manipal Hospital as the rude behaviour of the faculty has caused lot of inconvenience so to speak. 
Shame on a health care that has no value for money, time and people. I have visited several times before for my mother's recovery but not once have i found the ambience and support to revive with good health. I suggest the higher foundation grounds to look into better the hospital atmosphere. Highly disappointed with the Manipal Hospital Service. Will never recommend anyone to visit.",,

And hospital refused to give reports in my hand unless doctor appointment is completed. I never seen such a force to see doctor. And I left my reports with hospital and came back. Lack of coordination between front desk and lab assistant. Limited staff doing lot of things. They never give attention what you are telling. Even after repeated requests to give my reports they told me will not give you must see doctor. I suggest not to go this hospital for medical tests. Worst experience,,

Billing I do not want to comment.
We became fools to go and pay 1700/- for getting prescriptions like  Dolo and citrizen without even diagnosing and finding root cause.These prescriptions are given only after clearing the bill.

1 - If patient come minimum bill 3 Lakhs ( Mandatory )
2 - they wants to do all testing 1st ( MRI ,CT ) but reports will come only after 2 days were they can drag things and make maximum money.
3 - ICU  its not intensive care unit its called Income circulating unit for hospital.
4 - Billing not sure how they add money daily basses if you ask for a break down they will provide daily break down but not in details.

Sad but true if a Poor or middle class people go to these kind of hospital they should shell out all these saving and stand in road.

Not sure how these kind of hospitals are Regulated by govt and not helping people in anyways, please i request all the concern person to audit this hospital.",,"Hi Harsha.

Greetings!
Our experience has been very good. My father was in ICU for a month. The Public Relation Officer Ms.Indrani is fabulous. She helped us with all informations, provided the requisite facilities such as ambulance, information on services and methodologies to ease my dad's stay at Manipal Northside hospital.

At ICU all doctors and nurses took care of my father. I am able to hv my father by my side only because of doctors Dr.Dinesh Kamath, Dr.Shankarappa (fabulous), Dr. Arun Raykar, Dr. Nagesh, Dr.Basavaraj, Dr. Hemanth, duty doctors Dr.Santhosh, Dr. Geetha, Dr.Pavithra, Dr. Sachin, Nurses like Ms.Tancy.

At Administration Mr.Pramod, Ms. Ananthlakshmi, Mr. Raju; at ambulance both the drivers were very helpful. The housekeeping helped us all through.

All in all the hospital is very good. Only one need to hv patience. I hv seen my father's neighbour who had brain injury recovering so amazingly. Cost is certainly very high, but recovery is almost certain unless the patient is unable to cope. 

It is my suggestion that hospital authorities may find some way to bring cost down for lower middle class families then perhaps nobody can be better than ""Manipal Northside Hospital"".

Thank you all of you Manipal staff.

I was going here for almost 15 years but now I have stopped.  Now it is no longer good after it became Manipal Malleswaram.   Why?

1) All experienced Doctors who were here have all moved to other places like Apollo, Jain etc.

2) The OPD and Hospital - in 2 different places. Lot of issues for people as well as Doctors.

3) The hospital is simply focused on profits and not welfare of the people

4) I admitted my mother for 1 day . They just tried doing an aspiration procedure and could not even complete. For that they charged a bomb though they did nothing actually  (I knew how much it will cost for the same procedure as I had got it done earlier in another hospital as my mother was in another place when the illness was diagnosed - so I came to know).  I stopped going there though it was very near to my house in Malleswaram and started going to Ramaiah Hospitals  which was much better.  Manipal did not even give Discharge Summary. I followed for 2 weeks and left it as it was disgusting

5) The inexperienced doctors here even call you on your mobile, asking  you to go for some procedure (which we had decided against after Multiple Experts Opinion in the Field) just to get you admitted and make money. Can you believe, the Doctor even calls you and canvasses you to go for the procedure - like a Sales rep of Eureka Forbes Vacuum Cleaner

Admission:
Needs improvement as they send you to few places to check the estimates and insurance feasibilities. Which can definitely be improved by placing such help desks close so that we don't have to run around.

Other than that it was just amazing service at the admission desk

Room:
We took Delux room and it was no where less than a 5 star hotel experience. We wondered to see the cleanliness in this hospital. The rooms are spacious. Beautiful view from the windows. Great maintenance. Latest facilities available 5 stars for this. Check the photos to see the room.

Doctors:
Just blindly trust them. They are polite and down to the Earth. They listen to you very well. After seeing few operations today I felt these doctors are really living Gods.  5 starts again as I don't have anything after 5

Attendees and facilities:

5 starts. They are the best to make you feel better. These guys are so polite and well behaved.

Nursing :
No words to describe their duty. Every single thing is done on time and with must care. They take care of medication and food for you. They order what you should eat and at the very right time for you.

We met Greeshma and few other nursing staff (few names I don't remember. Really sorry about that ) they all show you such a great hospitality here. Greeshma said once the patient is here, we treat them like our guests 

Kavipriya was the best in making sure we had a good experience with nursing staff facilities and also to have a smooth insurance clearance and discharge. Thanks a ton for her too

Food:
The best. Patient gets a different food which should be the case all the time and attendees get different one. Had an awesome experience here too. Easy to order and delivered quick

Discharge:
I felt they are low in staff as so many people were waiting. Queuing is not properly handled here. That definitely needs improvement. A token system could help a lot.

Even though billing staff was too busy, I felt they did the best to make things faster.

Overall a great experience. Thanks a lot for world-class experience. You set the standards for others.

Thanks
